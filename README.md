# Agility
Agility adds new movement options to GarrysMod, including sliding, wall kicking, and ledge grabbing / climbing.

## Ledge Grabbing
- To grab onto a ledge, simply jump towards the edge while looking at it.
- Holding down **sprint** and **forward** allows you to climb ontop of a grabbed ledge.

## Wall kicking
- To kick off a wall, **jump** and hold down either **left** or **right**, depending upon if the wall is to your right or left.

## Sliding
- To slide, **sprint** and **crouch**.  Releasing **crouch** will end the slide.
- Sliding down a slope will speed you up, while sliding up a slope will slow you down.
